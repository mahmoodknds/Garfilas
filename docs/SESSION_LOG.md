### Latest Session: 3D Oven Background Scene — Visual Calibration Pass

**Date:** 2026-08-28

## Scope

This session focuses only on rebuilding and visually calibrating the Hero background while preserving the accepted foreground calibration.

## Reference Review

The updated `Result.png` was reviewed directly against the supplied reference before making the next code change.

The current output showed that the previous oven implementation was technically present in code but visually too weak: the screenshot still read primarily as a dark brick/architecture scene with an orange ring. The oven cavity, physical opening depth, warm interior source and lowered door were not visually legible enough.

This pass therefore increases the physical readability of the background rather than simply increasing a generic orange glow.

## Background Direction

The Hero background is treated as a native 3D-inspired scene rather than a decorative brick/grid texture.

The intended visual metaphor is an opened professional oven: a dark surrounding environment, a deep oven cavity, warm interior light, visible depth around the opening, an open door plane, heat haze and warm light spill toward the viewer.

### Implemented

- Removed the active brick-wall background composition from the Hero.
- Removed the active decorative architectural SVG layer from the Hero.
- Reworked the oven into a wider recessed portal so its geometry remains visible around the foreground artwork.
- Added a darker outer oven shell to establish physical thickness.
- Increased cavity depth and warm interior contrast.
- Increased left/right jamb width and perspective so the opening reads as a volume.
- Added a thicker top frame and ceiling light layer.
- Increased warm interior light spill while keeping the surrounding environment dark.
- Added a stronger perspective floor plane beneath the opening.
- Reworked the lowered oven door so the opening animation has a readable physical plane.
- Added a brighter threshold where the hot interior meets the open door.
- Increased heat haze visibility while keeping it soft and subordinate to the foreground.
- Preserved the distant Italian architecture only as a very faint atmospheric layer.
- Kept the scene behind the existing Garfield, single neon ring and typography stack.

## Protected Foreground

No intentional changes were made to the accepted foreground structure:

1. Temporary Garfield Hero + single neon ring
2. GARFILAS
3. LASAGNA + side lines
4. Italian flag
5. Slogan
6. `منو Menu` CTA
7. Upward scroll cue
8. Bottom Navigation

## Technical State

- `components/sections/Hero/Hero.tsx` owns the 3D oven background scene markup and responsive styling.
- The scene uses CSS perspective, transforms, gradients, shadows and controlled animation rather than a background screenshot.
- Existing unused background SVG assets remain in the repository for now and are not mounted by the active Hero.

## Verification State

- Updated `Result.png`: reviewed
- Previous oven scene readability: insufficient
- Recessed 3D oven shell: implemented
- Deeper warm cavity: implemented
- Physical jamb depth: implemented
- Open door depth: implemented
- Warm light spill: strengthened
- Heat haze: strengthened
- Foreground calibration: preserved
- Production build: not verified in this documentation update
- Final visual acceptance: pending next direct output comparison

## Exact Next Actions

1. Inspect the next deployed/mobile output directly.
2. Compare the visible oven depth against the supplied reference and the agreed oven-opening concept.
3. Tune only scale, depth, light spill and heat haze if needed.
4. Do not alter foreground positions during this background pass.
5. Verify desktop adaptation after mobile acceptance.
6. Run production build verification.
7. Do not expand project scope until Hero acceptance.
